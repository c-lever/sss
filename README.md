# homework of the 8th lesson

# For the person who will check my homework
# I have tested both files for speed: the first one is the original code without threads, and the second is my version with threads. I have run both files with the same command prompt (processing three identical text files of "The Great Gatsby" from the link provided in the homework assignment). I have executed each file 4 times.

# Here is the command prompt: "main.exe Z:\code\CppProjects\otus\hw8\example.txt Z:\code\CppProjects\otus\hw8\example.txt Z:\code\CppProjects\otus\hw8\example.txt"

# Here is the results of original code:
# 1. 524036 ms
# 2. 526650 ms
# 3. 523369 ms
# 4. 525443 ms
# avg is ~524875 ms

# Here is the results of my code:
# 1. 361850 ms
# 2. 357175 ms
# 3. 372797 ms
# 4. 366103 ms
# avg is ~364481 ms

# Therefore, my program runs ~160394 ms faster.
